Like the delicate #butterfly, we unfold our wings, #transcending #boundaries, and #awakening to the #essence of #spirituality. In this #cosmic #chess game, we are the players and the pawns, navigating the realms of existence with #wisdom and #purpose. And within the #depths of our #souls, we #discover the true #nobility that #transcends earthly titles, for true #royalty lies in the depth of our character, the #compassion of our #hearts, and the #radiance of our #spirits.

I made these lovely pieces a while back as a wedding present for a friend of a friend, I was so happy to hear that the couple loved their new plush pieces, and so do the students in their chess club at school!

I took my yarn with me across the country and back on a family vacation, so these two have seen the Grand Canyon and many of the filming locations for Breaking Bad 😅 it was awesome to get to work on such a large commission and I’m looking forward to more in the future!

If you have an idea for a custom piece, please dm me!

I used the pattern from ‘The Flying Dutchman Crochet Design’ on Etsy

As former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov stated in 2014: “Norway Chess is the Wimbledon of Chess”, and reminiscent of other major sports events such as indeed Wimbledon, Norway Chess is the strongest chess tournament since 2013.

This year, the tournament takes place May 29 – June 9 with a total prize fund of 2,500,000 NOK (≈ €220,000), featuring World No.1 Magnus Carlsen, World No.2 Alireza Firouzja, professional streamer and 5-time U.S. Champion Hikaru Nakamura (more than 2.5M followers on Youtube & Twitch), 2018 Challenger Fabiano Caruana, 17-year-old Indian chess prodigy Gukesh, and more world-class players. 

The tournament is being broadcasted in English on the biggest chess platform, Chess.com (1.22M subscribers), and on TV2Sport (Norwegian). The main sponsors, like the NES Fircroft, HTH Kjøkken, Ernst & Young Norway, and Norway Summit, have more than 270 minutes of logo exposure every day on the days of the event from multiple channels - online and offline -, and all year brand awareness through our social media channels, and google image library.

Only Round 1 was watched live by more than 281k viewers in at least 3 different languages, while the content created for Round 1 by youtubers and streamers, surpassed the 150k views in the first 16 hours. Our Twitter account reached 739K impressions/day (208.5% growth), and Instagram 3.5k post interactions (329% growth) the first 24 hours with just 7.5k followers when the tournament started.

It’s a dream come true and I’m delighted to be around all these great professionals from around the world, and also my chess idols.

AND ABOUT CHESS PUZZLES OR CHESS PROBLEMS:
~~ ---- ~~~~
Do you think puzzles 🧩 help make people better chess players? 

It helps but it's not the only thing necessary to become a good player. Yes Doing chess puzzles will help improve your ability to solve tactical problems in your own games. Most everyone agrees with that.

What is the benefit of chess puzzles?

~~ ---- ~~~~

The chess fan 🏟️ would learn a lot by trying to solve 2 movers (+ other chess problems) from the diagram and therefore train his/her mind's eye.  It is excellent training and the chess fan would learn many wonderful chess ideas that benefit his/her play (George has found solving chess problems a wonderful and pleasant hobby).

Chess Puzzles: 🧩 Keeps your mind sharp. 

The mind tends to get lazy and getting back into the habit of training can become more difficult. Solving a few puzzles a day keeps you in touch with chess and your mind working, so you can easily increase the volume of training when you decide to. Feb 2, 2021

* Parents and guardians will be able to know their child’s word automaticity and reading ability (word accuracy and words per minute)
* They will also receive recommendations for how to improve their child’s reading fluency over the summer  
* Invitation to join our summer virtual book club that aims to improve fluency
* Free literacy material giveaways to keep youth engaged in reading and writing throughout the summer such as journals, black literature, and more

Reading ability is a great predictor of future success. It is the foundation of all other learning (word problems in math; vocabulary in science; and primary sources in history). 

Joyous Tutoring improves the literacy of striving youth and particularly targets African-American boys and girls, though all youth are welcome, to address the present racial reading achievement gap here in Austin, TX.

1° Torneio de Xadrez de Rua 8/6/23

É com grande satisfação que informamos o lançamento de nosso primeiro torneio de xadrez de rua organizado pelos clubes de xadrez xadrez_embalo ,Xadrez da Glória e clubexadrezcopacabana 

O torneio será feito de forma coletiva, os próprios competidores levarão, se possível, peças, tabuleiros, relógios ou bancos para a realização do evento. O torneio será realizado na Praça Luís de Camões, no bairro da Glória, às 12h, no dia 8/06. O formato será um suíço de 6 rodadas, com o tempo de 5 minutos para cada jogador com 3 segundos de acréscimo por lance.

Caso você queira participar , por favor preencha o formulário que está na bio do perfil, para a melhor organização do evento.

Hoje vivemos em uma sociedade onde as crianças e jovens não têm condições de obter certo nível de cultura e igualdade social e principalmente de informações. Acreditamos que o xadrez aprimora a imaginação, dando a crianças e jovens motivos para sonhar e acreditar em um futuro brilhante através de seu próprio esforço e conhecimento.
Como já dizia Siegbert Tarrasch: “O xadrez, como o amor, como a música, tem o dom de fazer as pessoas felizes.” Visando o crescimento intelectual e a alegria dessas crianças, jovens e adultos, estamos fazendo um grande evento.

Contamos com a sua prestigiosa presença!

Evento gratuito!

PISA data now sees us score below the OECD average. In 2000 we were were in top 10. Maths really worries me! 

The solution is so obvious to me. I am so thankful I said yes to teaching in Mt Druitt, the Ryde district, at 3 unis and now on Darkinjung.

Our kids have not changed. Our teaching has to align with policy.
So, we need to change policy. My book is up to 28,000 words. 

Sigh- I am home sick today as my tongue is aching. I cannot keep talking. If talking was not essential I could work.

Náš svět se cca od Vánoc ponořil do šachu.. Tak jako Štěpána okouzlily vlajky a státy (pojmenuje všech tuším 254 bez zamyšlení) tak moc ho vzala královská hra.
A jak je u mě zvykem, zmíní se a já to kupuju, protože zaujmout autistu, to jako je věc! 😄
Koupila jsem šachy a že se blíží Vánoce? Tsss, prostě je máme hned. 
...
První meta byla porazit tátu, zásadně Štěpána nenecháváme vyhrát, cítil by se špatně. Dnes už tátovi vysvětluje kde udělal chybu. 
...
Před měsícem jsem mu koupila platinové členství na chess.com. Dám vám nick, rád si zahraje (lze to i zdarma).
...
A tenhle tyden byl DVAKRÁT! v sachovem klubu a má registraci. Dokonce i s těmi opravdu silnými kluky ziskal 2 výhry (a taky 6 proher🤭). Ale! Je to cca 6km co tenhle týden ušel, byl venku, byl šťastný a dokonce pak pronesl větu: Třeba si dokážu najít kamarady. Taky po šachu šel se mnou jeden den do restaurace na řízek a podruhe na zmrzlinu... 💪
...
Já umím max dámu ale hrozně se snažím orientovat když neustále slyším pojmy jako Dámský gambit, Skandinavska obrana, mat celé rodině, vidlička, rošáda, pěšcové koncovky apod. 😄 no a víte co, nejde mi to.. Ale i po návštěvě nemocnice jsme kupovali knihu o šachu a tak s ním nad ní sedím a chytře pokyvuju... Jsem z toho celá pryč!

6,"Be you. Make your move. 

In chess, each piece has a name and a role. Whether the King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn, all pieces working together is what helps a skilled chess player win the game. Daily living is a lot like this; many pieces to the game of life work together to allow you to be authentically who you are from dusk until dawn. 

If you know the rules of chess, you know that each piece can only move in specific directions. Have you ever felt like this? When you know what you need and even how to get there, but the moves necessary to accomplish the goals set for yourself are not a direct route?  You adapt, readjust, and overcome. 

As you move about your day today, be deliberate with each step as you move in all directions. Be cognizant if your surroundings and how all of life’s other players impact your game. Believe in the power of patience, understand that you can reset and start again, and above all else, be gentle with your thoughts and don’t be afraid to make your move. This is your life and you make the rules by simply being you.

9,"The advance of the h-pawn on move three is certainly not in line with the basic rules of how to play the opening. But in recent years a number of world-class players have been successful with it, including Magnus Carlsen, Ding Liren and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. And just a weeks ago at the Superbet Chess Classic in Bucharest, Fabiano Caruana managed an impressive winning game with it on his way to winning the tournament against MVL. Sipke Ernst recorded a FritzTrainer on 3.h4 against the Grünfeld and King's Indian half a year ago. In the new CBM Extra #213 he provides an update with current material - you can see an excerpt of his analysis here!

يتردد مكسيم بيكافيه كونه من فريق الأحجار البيضاء، في الخطوة التي سيتخذها بين مربعات عدة سوداء تحيطه، ثم يتّخذ قراره واقفاً على القطعة القماشية التي تظهر عليها المربعات السوداء والبيضاء، في ظل نظرات زملائه الثلاثة الذين يشاركونه اللعب وأستاذه المتخصّص جان- فرنسوا بورشيه.

وبيكافيه البالغ 18 عاماً مُصاب بطيف التوحد، فيما يعاني زملاؤه أنجيلين وعثمان وإيثان اضطرابات معرفية. ويرتدي كل منهم تاجاً عليه الرمز الذي يمثله كقطعة في الشطرنج، فيضع أحدهم تاجاً يظهر رمز الأسقف مثلاً بينما يمثل تاج مراهق آخر الرخ (القلعة).

وسرعان ما تقصي أنجلين التي تفاخر كونها تمثّل القطعة الأقوى في اللعبة وهي الملكة، مكسيم من اللعبة. ويقول بورشيه، ""لا يقتصر هدف هذه التجربة على الفوز والخسارة فقط، بل هم يختبرون اللعبة بأنفسهم"". ويقول مكسيم ""أتخيّل نفسي في مملكة"".

چرا خیلی از نابغه‌ها سرنوشت تلخی دارند؟ چرا خودشان را با الکل و مواد مخدر جوان‌مرگ می‌کنند؟ فکر می‌کنیم آن‌ها چون نابغه‌اند، چون ذهنشان یا بدنشان قدرتی مهیب و مهارناپذیر دارد، درگیر مشکلاتی می‌شوند که ما آدم‌ معمولی‌ها درکش نمی‌کنیم. آن‌ها به چیزهایی می‌اندیشند و از چیزهایی آسیب می‌بینند که برای ما ناشناخته است، پس راهی نداریم جز آنکه کنار رویم و ببینیم چطور زندگی‌شان را تباه می‌کنند. اما اگنس کالارد مخالف است. از نظر او، جامعه نابغه‌ها را طرد می‌کند و همین نابودشان می‌کند.

13,"The New York Times series Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported, has chosen to highlight Sultan Khan. This unassuming man from a small town in Punjab, from a family of landowners and pirs, went on to become a chess champion the world respected and rivals feared. He first became the All-India Chess Champion in 1928, and then won the British Chess Championship in 1929, 1932 and 1933. During a whirlwind period of four years, he competed against the world’s best chess players and more than held his own. He went back to India in 1933, and never played another chess match again. 

If you want to know more about this remarkable man, his grandchildren are said to be currently writing a book about him!

[ENG/PL]

Hello!

📚 The deal of a lifetime, Fredrik Backman
📚 It's a story about a guy who made some choices during his life
📚 I feel like the author has the gift of describing real feelings, people, and situations
📚 And no matter, what the story is about, we can find ourselves in it and maybe it will teach us that we're not alone; that other people had similar experiences, and that perhaps we can change how we see the world around us just a little

How about you? Have you read it? Or is it on your tbr? Or maybe you just don't care about that title?
__________

Cześć!

📚 The deal of a lifetime, Fredrik Backman
📚 Historia o człowieku, który dokonał pewnych wyborów
📚 Mam wrażenie, że autor ma niesamowity talent do opisu uczuć, ludzi i sytuacji
📚 I nieważne o czym jest historia, możemy w niej odnaleźć siebie i być może nauczy nas ona, że nie jesteśmy sami; że inni ludzie mieli podobne doświadczenia i możliwe, że zmieni to sposób w jaki patrzymy na świat wokół nas

A jak tam u Was? Czytaliście? Macie na liście do przeczytania? A może tytuł Was nie interesuje?

14,"Being a leader means always evolving; that's how you stay fresh. 🌱🌻🌞 Let me put you on game a bit. 🧩

Tip #1 is Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice (evil) that which can be explain by ignorance (lack of knowledge). ✅ You start to mix up genuine criticism from family with random meaningless negativity. You must make the distinction. 💯

Sometimes it can feel like hate it judgement but oftentimes they simply don't understand your life. 🌎 That's fine, because not everyone is supposed to! ✌️

Play your role and let them play theirs. Take time before responding. Gather your thoughts and give your subconscious time to process. It's not easy but it's critical. 🗝️

We can't always predict what will happen, but we can always try to make the best decisions possible. #chess #life #quotes #inspiration #motivation.

Patience and when to make the right move, thinking before you do something, always have strategy, be two moves ahead before it's even happened, study your opponents, need to know everything that's going on around you, focus, but most important be humble and level headed but know when aggression is needed 

So pretty much everything opposite to dad

Tom va al liceo ed è innamorato della bella Harmony. Quando viene a sapere che lei gioca a scacchi, decide di iscriversi anche lui al circolo di scacchi della scuola. Solo che non conosce neanche le regole! Non ha scelta allora: deve imparare ed allenarsi seriamente.
Ben presto scopre Garry Kasparov, il più grande giocatore di scacchi della storia.

28,"Regola numero 1: 
Controlla il centro della scacchiera. 
Prova a occupare le caselle centrali con i tuoi pezzi, in modo da avere un controllo più ampio del tabellone e una maggiore flessibilità nel tuo gioco. Ricorda, il controllo del centro ti permette di sferrare attacchi più potenti e tenere sotto controllo le mosse dell'avversario.

Regola numero 2: 
Pianifica attentamente il tuo gioco. 
Prenditi il tempo necessario per analizzare la posizione del tuo avversario, valutare le mosse possibili e sviluppare una solida strategia. Ricorda, una buona pianificazione ti mette in vantaggio già dalla prima mossa!

Regola numero 3: 
Proteggi il tuo re. 
Assicurati sempre di tenerlo al sicuro, creando un adeguato sistema di difesa attorno a esso. Mantieni le tue pedine vicino al re e sviluppa una struttura difensiva solida. Ricorda, il re in pericolo può portare alla sconfitta, quindi prendi le giuste precauzioni per proteggerlo.

Paolo Maurensig scrive la biografia di Paul Morphy: uno dei più abili giocatori di scacchi di tutti i tempi, presentando anche uno spaccato della società ottocentesca. 
L' attenzione alla ricostruzione storica degli eventi è lodevole e la penna di Maurensig scorre veloce per una analisi introspettiva di Morphy che non annoia il lettore. Geniale la numerazione dei capitoli con le mosse della partita Paulsen - Morphy, New York 1857.
#labibliotecaconsiglia agli amanti del gioco degli scacchi e non. 

📚 Sommario/Abstract:
Sessantaquattro caselle. Trentadue figure. E una possibilità combinatoria pressoché infinita. Nessuna partita di scacchi è uguale a un'altra. Ognuna è una sfida unica, giocata su quel quadrato magico che è la scacchiera: quasi un mondo fuori dal mondo. Paul Morphy è stato un autentico artista della scacchiera, forse il più grande. Nella sua brevissima parabola, sospesa sull'esile filo che separa la genialità dalla follia, ha incarnato alla perfezione l'essenza del ""nobile gioco"". Paul nasce a New Orleans, da una famiglia facoltosa, nel 1837. Ha solo quattro anni quando rivela il proprio straordinario talento. A dodici anni è già il più forte giocatore della Louisiana e, non ancora maggiorenne, si laurea campione degli Stati Uniti con una facilità disarmante. A quel punto non gli resta che affrontare i più famosi campioni europei, e soprattutto quello che molti considerano il migliore al mondo: Howard Staunton. L'ambizione di Paul non conosce ostacoli. Come un cavaliere, sprezzante di qualunque premio che non sia la gloria, Morphy parte per la sua missione accompagnato da un ambiguo scudiero, il giornalista Frederick Milnes Edge, lasciando la solatia città natale per smarrirsi nelle nebbie londinesi. Chi era in realtà Paul Morphy? Quali accadimenti spensero la fiamma del suo genio, inducendolo ad abbandonare per sempre gli scacchi all'apice della carriera, e a ritirarsi?

3rd place - Mike Lambert with 5.5 points

2nd place - Sam Merchant with 6 points

1st place - Sharon Merchant with 6.5 points

A massive congratulations to Sharon as a significant piece of history was made with this result, as no female member has won a club competition for at least 22 years (as long has Joe has been in the club). As a result of this Sharon and Sam gain promotion.

A huge well done to everyone that took part in what was a very close competition.
