AND ABOUT CHESS PUZZLES OR CHESS PROBLEMS:
~~ ---- ~~~~
Do you think puzzles 🧩 help make people better chess players? 

It helps but it's not the only thing necessary to become a good player. Yes Doing chess puzzles will help improve your ability to solve tactical problems in your own games. Most everyone agrees with that.

What is the benefit of chess puzzles?

~~ ---- ~~~~

The chess fan 🏟️ would learn a lot by trying to solve 2 movers (+ other chess problems) from the diagram and therefore train his/her mind's eye.  It is excellent training and the chess fan would learn many wonderful chess ideas that benefit his/her play (George has found solving chess problems a wonderful and pleasant hobby).

Chess Puzzles: 🧩 Keeps your mind sharp. 

The mind tends to get lazy and getting back into the habit of training can become more difficult. Solving a few puzzles a day keeps you in touch with chess and your mind working, so you can easily increase the volume of training when you decide to. Feb 2, 2021

Ferrari is 4th, 30 points behind Aston and 29 behind Mercedes

It's unlikely they'll recover 15 points per race: they will probably have the largest allocation of the top 4

On the other hand, Lance’s underperformance could be a good asset for Alonso’s chances of having strong car development!

2,"We are excited to announce that we will be collaborating with the Carver Musuem to offer free reading fluency assessments for students entering grades 1st-8th during their Juneteenth Family Cookout 🍗and Music 🎶 Festival! 

* Parents and guardians will be able to know their child’s word automaticity and reading ability (word accuracy and words per minute)
* They will also receive recommendations for how to improve their child’s reading fluency over the summer  
* Invitation to join our summer virtual book club that aims to improve fluency
* Free literacy material giveaways to keep youth engaged in reading and writing throughout the summer such as journals, black literature, and more

Reading ability is a great predictor of future success. It is the foundation of all other learning (word problems in math; vocabulary in science; and primary sources in history). 

Joyous Tutoring improves the literacy of striving youth and particularly targets African-American boys and girls, though all youth are welcome, to address the present racial reading achievement gap here in Austin, TX.

2,"Just because school is out doesn’t mean the reading stops! Join Joyous Tutoring’s first-ever Virtual Book Club as we keep our youth engaged with literacy throughout the summer with the latest Black Young Adult Novels and Children’s Books. We will be using culturally-meaningful literature and primary sources to strengthen their reading and writing abilities. There will be rewards for youth who attend all 6 sessions and awards for those who increase their reading proficiency. Limited spots available! Sign-up today with the link in the bio. Hit me up if you have any questions! “Always improving’ & maneuverin’, this is Joyous Tutoring!”

1° Torneio de Xadrez de Rua 8/6/23

É com grande satisfação que informamos o lançamento de nosso primeiro torneio de xadrez de rua organizado pelos clubes de xadrez xadrez_embalo ,Xadrez da Glória e clubexadrezcopacabana 

O torneio será feito de forma coletiva, os próprios competidores levarão, se possível, peças, tabuleiros, relógios ou bancos para a realização do evento. O torneio será realizado na Praça Luís de Camões, no bairro da Glória, às 12h, no dia 8/06. O formato será um suíço de 6 rodadas, com o tempo de 5 minutos para cada jogador com 3 segundos de acréscimo por lance.

Caso você queira participar , por favor preencha o formulário que está na bio do perfil, para a melhor organização do evento.

Hoje vivemos em uma sociedade onde as crianças e jovens não têm condições de obter certo nível de cultura e igualdade social e principalmente de informações. Acreditamos que o xadrez aprimora a imaginação, dando a crianças e jovens motivos para sonhar e acreditar em um futuro brilhante através de seu próprio esforço e conhecimento.
Como já dizia Siegbert Tarrasch: “O xadrez, como o amor, como a música, tem o dom de fazer as pessoas felizes.” Visando o crescimento intelectual e a alegria dessas crianças, jovens e adultos, estamos fazendo um grande evento.

Contamos com a sua prestigiosa presença!

Evento gratuito!

3,"¿Estás de acuerdo con las palabras de #NigelShort? | Hoy cumple 58 años uno de los mejores jugadores ingleses de la historia del ajedrez. Tres veces campeón británico y mejor conocido por clasificarse para desafiar a Garry Kasparov por el campeonato mundial en 1993. Después de que Short se clasificara a través de la FIDE, ambos jugadores se separaron de la organización para jugar su match, que ganó Kasparov.

Short se convirtió en MI en 1980 a la edad de solo 14 años. Aunque ahora es una edad en la que varios jugadores han hecho no solo MI sino GM , en ese momento probablemente era el MI más joven de la historia. ( Es posible que Bobby Fischer y Henrique Mecking hayan llegado antes, pero no se dispone de registros irrefutables).

Hasta la fecha, Short sigue siendo el único ajedrecista inglés en ganar un torneo de candidatos por el título indiscutible. Solo otros dos, y solo uno nacido en Inglaterra, han jugado en algún campeonato mundial desde 1886. Johannes Zukertort, quien se mudó a Londres en 1872 y moriría y sería enterrado allí, jugó contra Wilhelm Steinitz en 1886. El otro es Michael Adams, quien fue subcampeón en el Campeonato Mundial de 2004 de la FIDE. Adams, que ganó siete Campeonatos Británicos de Ajedrez, es uno de los pocos jugadores además de Short (Howard Staunton sería otro) que tiene un caso como el mejor ajedrecista británico de todos los tiempos.

1/10 scale (60cmx60cm Chessboard)

Those stools are part of Éché, a chessboard from Lébayes collections. Showcasing the seamless integration of human creativity and precise technological capabilities in a design process, Lébayes bridges digital and analog. Its form embodies the symbiotic relationship between artistic vision and machine's algorithmic ingenuity.

In a digital realm, we shape a virtual volume, carving out the essence of our vision. What remains is a mold, a hollowed space in three dimensions. Guided by an algorithm inspired by nature's wisdom, structures grow within the mold, breathing life into our creation and modeling the objects. 

What if we dared to relinquish the creative reins to a computer? What if we viewed this machine not merely as a tool, but as a partner, a collaborator, a bona fide designer?

Manufactured and crafted in between Rotterdam and Paris in Collaboration with lucaszitolouisor for our common studio.recre

I made these lovely pieces a while back as a wedding present for a friend of a friend, I was so happy to hear that the couple loved their new plush pieces, and so do the students in their chess club at school!

I took my yarn with me across the country and back on a family vacation, so these two have seen the Grand Canyon and many of the filming locations for Breaking Bad 😅 it was awesome to get to work on such a large commission and I’m looking forward to more in the future!

If you have an idea for a custom piece, please dm me!

I used the pattern from ‘The Flying Dutchman Crochet Design’ on Etsy

Náš svět se cca od Vánoc ponořil do šachu.. Tak jako Štěpána okouzlily vlajky a státy (pojmenuje všech tuším 254 bez zamyšlení) tak moc ho vzala královská hra.
A jak je u mě zvykem, zmíní se a já to kupuju, protože zaujmout autistu, to jako je věc! 😄
Koupila jsem šachy a že se blíží Vánoce? Tsss, prostě je máme hned. 
...
První meta byla porazit tátu, zásadně Štěpána nenecháváme vyhrát, cítil by se špatně. Dnes už tátovi vysvětluje kde udělal chybu. 
...
Před měsícem jsem mu koupila platinové členství na chess.com. Dám vám nick, rád si zahraje (lze to i zdarma).
...
A tenhle tyden byl DVAKRÁT! v sachovem klubu a má registraci. Dokonce i s těmi opravdu silnými kluky ziskal 2 výhry (a taky 6 proher🤭). Ale! Je to cca 6km co tenhle týden ušel, byl venku, byl šťastný a dokonce pak pronesl větu: Třeba si dokážu najít kamarady. Taky po šachu šel se mnou jeden den do restaurace na řízek a podruhe na zmrzlinu... 💪
...
Já umím max dámu ale hrozně se snažím orientovat když neustále slyším pojmy jako Dámský gambit, Skandinavska obrana, mat celé rodině, vidlička, rošáda, pěšcové koncovky apod. 😄 no a víte co, nejde mi to.. Ale i po návštěvě nemocnice jsme kupovali knihu o šachu a tak s ním nad ní sedím a chytře pokyvuju... Jsem z toho celá pryč!

PISA data now sees us score below the OECD average. In 2000 we were were in top 10. Maths really worries me! 

The solution is so obvious to me. I am so thankful I said yes to teaching in Mt Druitt, the Ryde district, at 3 unis and now on Darkinjung.

Our kids have not changed. Our teaching has to align with policy.
So, we need to change policy. My book is up to 28,000 words. 

Sigh- I am home sick today as my tongue is aching. I cannot keep talking. If talking was not essential I could work.

👉 It's time for a chess quote! ♟

#ccgames #chess #checkers #chessquote #quoteoftheday. Image description: arafed image of a chess piece with a quote on it"
8,"Be you. Make your move. 

In chess, each piece has a name and a role. Whether the King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn, all pieces working together is what helps a skilled chess player win the game. Daily living is a lot like this; many pieces to the game of life work together to allow you to be authentically who you are from dusk until dawn. 

If you know the rules of chess, you know that each piece can only move in specific directions. Have you ever felt like this? When you know what you need and even how to get there, but the moves necessary to accomplish the goals set for yourself are not a direct route?  You adapt, readjust, and overcome. 

As you move about your day today, be deliberate with each step as you move in all directions. Be cognizant if your surroundings and how all of life’s other players impact your game. Believe in the power of patience, understand that you can reset and start again, and above all else, be gentle with your thoughts and don’t be afraid to make your move. This is your life and you make the rules by simply being you.

10,"Being a leader means always evolving; that's how you stay fresh. 🌱🌻🌞 Let me put you on game a bit. 🧩

Tip #1 is Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice (evil) that which can be explain by ignorance (lack of knowledge). ✅ You start to mix up genuine criticism from family with random meaningless negativity. You must make the distinction. 💯

Sometimes it can feel like hate it judgement but oftentimes they simply don't understand your life. 🌎 That's fine, because not everyone is supposed to! ✌️

Play your role and let them play theirs. Take time before responding. Gather your thoughts and give your subconscious time to process. It's not easy but it's critical. 🗝️

11,"One day ill show Aston this photo when he is older and tell him it's not checkers or chess I've been teaching him these early years but it's about driving...

Patience and when to make the right move, thinking before you do something, always have strategy, be two moves ahead before it's even happened, study your opponents, need to know everything that's going on around you, focus, but most important be humble and level headed but know when aggression is needed 

So pretty much everything opposite to dad

14,"The New York Times series Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported, has chosen to highlight Sultan Khan. This unassuming man from a small town in Punjab, from a family of landowners and pirs, went on to become a chess champion the world respected and rivals feared. He first became the All-India Chess Champion in 1928, and then won the British Chess Championship in 1929, 1932 and 1933. During a whirlwind period of four years, he competed against the world’s best chess players and more than held his own. He went back to India in 1933, and never played another chess match again. 

If you want to know more about this remarkable man, his grandchildren are said to be currently writing a book about him!

[ENG/PL]

Hello!

📚 The deal of a lifetime, Fredrik Backman
📚 It's a story about a guy who made some choices during his life
📚 I feel like the author has the gift of describing real feelings, people, and situations
📚 And no matter, what the story is about, we can find ourselves in it and maybe it will teach us that we're not alone; that other people had similar experiences, and that perhaps we can change how we see the world around us just a little

How about you? Have you read it? Or is it on your tbr? Or maybe you just don't care about that title?
__________

Cześć!

📚 The deal of a lifetime, Fredrik Backman
📚 Historia o człowieku, który dokonał pewnych wyborów
📚 Mam wrażenie, że autor ma niesamowity talent do opisu uczuć, ludzi i sytuacji
📚 I nieważne o czym jest historia, możemy w niej odnaleźć siebie i być może nauczy nas ona, że nie jesteśmy sami; że inni ludzie mieli podobne doświadczenia i możliwe, że zmieni to sposób w jaki patrzymy na świat wokół nas

A jak tam u Was? Czytaliście? Macie na liście do przeczytania? A może tytuł Was nie interesuje?

14,"""And the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently. And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal. And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.""

15,"AI fever is spreading rapidly, and even chess.com wants a slice of the action! Introducing their latest innovation: the AI adjudicator.

Chess.com has always been determined to combat cheating, but let's face it, some individuals still manage to slip through the cracks. In fact, we have even advocated in the past that you should proactively report anyone who defeats you, because they MUST be cheating.

However, in their latest endeavor to tackle cheating, chess.com has enlisted the help of a shiny new AI to provide support. What makes the AI adjudicator intriguing is that it doesn't merely ban cheaters; its purpose is to instill a burning sense of shame in those who engage in cheating during chess matches, with the hope of guiding them towards righteousness. When it detects a cheater, it appears with a mock expression of disappointment and delivers snarky comments such as ""Cheating, huh?"" and ""I'm soooo disappointed in you.""

The pivotal question is whether this unorthodox approach will prove effective. Can the AI's snarky remarks genuinely reform these bothersome cheaters? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!

15,"The advance of the h-pawn on move three is certainly not in line with the basic rules of how to play the opening. But in recent years a number of world-class players have been successful with it, including Magnus Carlsen, Ding Liren and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. And just a weeks ago at the Superbet Chess Classic in Bucharest, Fabiano Caruana managed an impressive winning game with it on his way to winning the tournament against MVL. Sipke Ernst recorded a FritzTrainer on 3.h4 against the Grünfeld and King's Indian half a year ago. In the new CBM Extra #213 he provides an update with current material - you can see an excerpt of his analysis here!

16,"おはようございます！

変わったようで変わっていないのかもしれない川沿いの整備工事の進捗の様子を、店の中から眺めるグルマン店主です。

店舗横の歩道の煉瓦工事は終わりに近づいているようです。
これから車道の煉瓦工事が始まるようなので、来店の際はお気をつけください。

少しF1の話を。
先週はモナコGP。そして、今週はスペインGP。

世界各国を飛び回るF1サーカスですが、今はヨーロッパ圏での連戦中です。

今シーズン、好調なのはGP連覇中の王者フェルスタッペンと元世界王者のアロンソ。

アロンソは、現在41歳。
通常は引退していてもおかしくない年齢のドライバーですが、今シーズンはドライバーズランキング3位につける好成績をおさめています。

節制やトレーニングでコンディションを維持しているのでしょうが、同じくらいの年齢のグルマン店主から見ると本当に凄いなと思います。

反射神経や運動能力は年齢と共に落ちてきてしまうのは必然で、そこを何でカバーするかをよく理解しているからこそ出来る現在の成績。
ベテランと呼ばれる年代の選手のアドバンテージを最大限に発揮して連覇中の王者に挑む姿は、見ていて胸が熱くなります。

今週のアロンソは自身の母国でのGP。
10年振りの母国での勝利を期待しつつ、今日もカレーを作ります！
